## Description

A program designed to help a pizza delivery driver find the correct path in a maze sent as a text file. All three of the programs in the repository use BFS, but vary in difficulty from simply finding the shortest path to having to consider microwaves to heat the pizza along the way. In the end, the path the driver took is displayed in a ppm file.

#### Language

- Java
